 Introduction:
===============

 The Amstrad CPC range was an 8bit microcomputer family released on June 21st, 1984. These computers 
were sold as a complete bundle including a colour or green screen monitor and a main storage system. 
CPC was an acronym of Colour Personal Computer. The first digit was a code for the main storage system; 
'4' denoted a tape deck and '6' a 3-inch floppy disk drive. The Amstrad CPC range included the following 
models:

-	Amstrad CPC 464, 64Kb RAM
-	Amstrad CPC 472, 64Kb RAM (only sold in Spain)
-	Amstrad CPC 664, 64Kb RAM
-	Amstrad CPC 6128, 128Kb RAM

 The CPC series was very popular in Europe, mainly in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany (where 
the CPC was sold under the Schneider brand). Amstrad plc. entered the computing market with the CPC series. 
They even dominated the European market with their PC clones the PC1512 and 1640. Sales of CPC units are 
estimated at about 2 million.

You are looking at a machine thats hardware was packed with its Z80A 4MHz processor, 4 channels of sound that 
made for perfect atmospheres in games, and a very advanced graphical chip for its time: different graphical 
modes and graphical resolutions changes whilst running. Very few machines have been as big as the CPC was, 
it survived for more than 10 years and it's a beloved and well known machine by two generations of computing 
fans that remember it.


 About Wiituka:
===============

WiituKa is an Amstrad CPC6128 emulator for the Wii system based on my last work Pituka for GamePark32.

My hope is that you enjoy this emulator and people who don't know this marvellous machine can enjoy it, even 
today there are new remake releases, you only have to look at the NES remakes released for the GBA.


WII Features:
- A comfortable Interface that tries to resemble "Virtual Console"
- With online support, download your games from coach.
- First emulator with CPC Gunstick Emulation (Yeah!)


 INSTALATION:
==============

 - COPY "apps" dir to your SD CARD.

 - Create new directory for your ROMS, APPS\WIITUKA\DISKS and copy your ZIP files to the new directory.
	Anyway, PituKa creates his need it directory automaticaly:

		SD-CARD
		|
                |-----> APPS ---> WIITUKA (EMULATOR BINARY)
                                  |
		                  --------> DISKS (ROM FILES HERE)
                                  |
                                  --------> SAVES (SAVESTATES HERE)
                                  |          
                                  --------> SCREENS (YOUR SCREENSHOTS)

 - Happy emulation ;D
 

 CONTROLS:
===========

 There are 2 modes besides the KEYBOARD that is detected at the beginning:

	MODE 1 JOYSTICK: 
		
		MOTE		:	AMSTRAD
		-------------------------------------
		<>^v (PAD)	:	JOY DIRECTIONS 
		(2)		:	[FIRE]
		(1)		:	[FIRE2]
		(HOME)		:	PAUSE EMULATION / MENU 	



	MODO 2 USER: (DEFAULT CFG)
		
		MOTE		:	AMSTRAD
		-------------------------------------
		<>^v (PAD)	:	CURSOR KEYS
		(2)		:	[A]
		(1)		:	SPACE
		(HOME)		:	PAUSE EMULATION / MENU 	

        You can redefine this keys using Keyboard-On-Screen and 
        press Button B (on Key to Bind) + Any Button on your Wiimote / Wii Classic Control.


	KEYBOARD:
		USB		:	AMSTRAD
		-------------------------------------
		[ยบ]		:	[|] 
		[NP1], [NP2]	:	[F1], [F2]...

	CLASSIC PAD:
		- ALL KEYS ARE AVAILABLE TO BIND.


          Problems using KEYBOARD:
          -------------------------
	   These problems arent fault of the emulator but also the support that we have
	   of the KEYBOARD is simple at the moment (although perfectly stable),
	   the problems detected are:

            PROBLEM : The emulator detects my KEYBOARD that is perfectly connected
		      but into the emulation dont have a response.
	    SOLUTION: Change your USB KEYBOARD to other, some models are not fully compatible 
		      with the Wii Drivers.


        ROMLIST/MENU:
		(A)	- RESET EMULATION, LOAD DISK AND AUTORUN.
		(B)	- LOAD DISK ONLY.

		(HOME)	- RETURN TO EMULATION (IN MAIN MENU)


 Play a Game using Autorun:
============================
	Pituka emulates a real CPC even in code of the autorun i want to be accurate, to
	load a disk and activate the AUTORUN from start menu, follow this steps:
	- INSERT DISK -> [A]
	- Select a Rom that you want load with [A] (with DSK extension of course).
	- Now appear the file list that you can load, normally you may follow this preference order:
	  BAS -> BIN -> . (WITHOUT EXTENSION) -> |CPM
	- If you dont see any BAS file, you may search a BIN file and continues... if you dont see any type of file
	  when you may selecct |CPM to load the game.
	- When you have selected the file to load your game, you returned to start menu and just left reset CPC
	  if you have got any game later. Press [START] to return to emulation.

	- Some times when you load a game and selects the autorun file, when you return to emulation
	  the autorun string dont appear, to appear change your PAD-MODE using [R], i cant fix this error
	  because I dont have much time... sorry :(

		
	
 Play a Game without Autorun:
==============================
	
	Pituka emulates a real CPC, which means you have to do the same as you would with a real CPC to run 
	a game. Con la suerte que en esta nueva version los poseedores de un CHATBOARD lo tienen mas comodo ;)

	To play a game, you must insert a disk image and type two basic commands, let see what they are:

		- To insert a disc image. press [START] and choose INSERT DISK in the main menu.

		- Select a DSK and you'll be back in the main menu. Press [START] to return to the
		 	emulation.

		- Now you have to know what files the disc image has. It's easy, go to the virtual 
			keyboard with [R] and type [C][A][T] , then press SELECT to execute that
			command.

		- Now, you'll see a files list. The important filetypes are BIN, BAS or without 
			extension, Ex: ABADIA.BAS, GRYZOR.BIN, TETRIS.

		- Now type [R][U][N]["] to execute a file. There is a tip to do this faster, look at 				                        the bottom.You can get the ["] symbol pressing the buttons [L] and the [2] vkey.

		- Now type the name (you can include the extension if you want yo be sure what file are 
			you running), for example: [G][R][Y][Z][O][R][.][B][I][N], and then press 
			[RETURN].

		- Tips time: type the name of the file and then place the cursor at the beginning of the 
                        name. then press [CTRL] with the [A] button and without depress it, press [INTRO].
                        This will then put [R][U][N]["] in front of the file name and launch the game.

		- For some games you don't need to type the  RUN" command, they load with the |CPM command 
                        They are easily detectable. If when you execute the CAT command, you get an error 
                        (ignore, Cancel) then these games are protected, but don't worry about it, they 
                        are even easier to execute, you only must type:
			[|][C][P][M] and the Press [RETURN].
			You can get the [|] symbol pressing the buttons [L] and then vkey to the RIGHT of [P].



 How is save the configuration keys.
================================================
 The philosophy that follow the code of "Unique Game Save Keys" is:
	- Once diffent config for DSK/ZIP file.
	- The config is save and is load every time when you change your ROM.
	- If the ROM dont have any config file this is create a new file with the actual
	  config and it is load again.
